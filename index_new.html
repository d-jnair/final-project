    <h1>Africa Wildfires 2024: From Routine Cycles to Crisis</h1>
    <p>A year of fire across Africa shows how predictable, low‑intensity burning patterns are starting to tip toward more unpredictable, intense events.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="intro" id="hook">
    <p>Of all the land that burns worldwide each year, more than half is in Africa. Most of the time it’s savannas in the dry season, with fires set for farming or grazing. They’re frequent, but usually low‑intensity, expected and a part of how these landscapes work.</p>
    <p>In recent years, however, this pattern has started to shift. 2024 is one of the clearest examples so far: some countries inside the “normal” fire belt, and some wetter regions around it, see more fires and more damaging seasons than the year before. The data suggests Africa’s fire regime is changing, with climate change quietly pushing conditions toward bigger risks.</p>
