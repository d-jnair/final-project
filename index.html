    <h1>Africa Wildfires 2024: From Routine Cycles to Crisis</h1>
    <p>A year of fire across Africa shows how predictable, low‑intensity burning patterns are starting to tip toward more unpredictable, intense events.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="intro" id="hook">
    <p>Of all the land that burns worldwide each year, more than half is in Africa. Most of the time it’s savannas in the dry season, with fires set for farming or grazing. They’re frequent, but usually low‑intensity and a part of how these landscapes work.</p>
    <p>In recent years, however, this pattern has started to shift and 2024 is one of the clearest examples so far. The data suggests Africa’s fire regime is changing, with climate change quietly pushing conditions toward bigger risks.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 1 – Early‑Year Savanna Belt (Jan–Mar)</h2>
        <p>From January to March, the fire detections form a tight band across countries like Guinea, Ghana, Nigeria, the Central African Republic, and South Sudan. This is the classic early dry‑season savanna belt: dry grass and crop residues being burned for land management in hot, windy conditions. In other words, this is the “normal” part of Africa’s fire story – lots of fires, but mostly in ecosystems that are used to frequent low‑intensity burning.</p>

      <section data-chapter="1-compare">
        <h3>2023 vs 2024 comparison</h3>
        <p>When we compare annual fire counts in this belt between 2023 and 2024, several of these countries edge upward instead of downward. Places like South Sudan, Nigeria, Guinea, and Sierra Leone all show more fires. The changes aren’t huge or dramatic, but this is just the start to show that what typically is just controlled low intensity fires may be something more. </p>

      <section data-chapter="2">
        <h2>Chapter 2 – Congo region anomaly (Jun–Aug)</h2>
        <p>By mid‑year, the belt of activity shifted south and piled up around the Congo region, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Congo, Angola and Tanzania. This is the Congo Basin region, the world’s second‑largest tropical forest. Historically, the wet forests of the Congo Basin have been too humid to burn often, so most large fires stayed in surrounding savannas and woodlands.</p>

      <section data-chapter="2-compare">
        <h3>2023 vs 2024 comparison</h3>
        <p>In 2024, that boundary starts to blur. Countries around the Basin show more fires than they did in 2023. This is happening in a region that is vitally important for slowing climate change: the Congo Basin is estimated to hold roughly 8% of the world’s forest‑based carbon in its trees and soils. When these forests burn, they don’t just lose biomass. They also release stored carbon back into the atmosphere.</p>

      <section data-chapter="2-congo">
        <h3>Congo specific comparison</h3>
        <p>In Congo itself, there is nearly a 50% increase in the number of fires from 2023 to 2024. This is a place that rarely burned in the past because of its rainforest climate. Here is the key moment where Africa’s 2024 fire regime starts to look less like “savannas doing what they’ve always done” and more like an early warning sign of more unpredictable, and uncontrollable fires.</p>

      <section data-chapter="3">
        <h2>Chapter 3 – Southern peak and fire crises (Sep–Oct)</h2>
        <p>Between September and October, the fire migrates further south. Angola, Zambia, Mozambique, and South Africa light up as the dry season reaches them. This continues the seasonal cycle, but the consequences start to look slightly different.</p>
        <p>Comparing 2023 and 2024 in this southern cluster, several countries north of South Africa and in its vicinity, see more fires in 2024 than in the year before. </p>

        <h3>South Africa comparison</h3>
        <p>At the same time, South Africa’s 2024 fire season becomes one of the deadliest and most damaging on record, even without a huge spike in the number of detected fires. In other words, even if the fire count doesn’t increase, the intensity and impact of those fires can still rise. </p>

        <h2>Chapter 4 – Savanna Belt Cycle Return (Nov–Dec)</h2>
        <p>At the end of the year, the fires migrate back toward the central African savanna belt as the next dry season begins. The map starts to resemble the early‑year pattern again, and the cycle continues, only with each year we get hotter, drier and more destructive fires. </p>

      <section data-chapter="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Across all chapters, the 2024 Africa map still traces the familiar dry‑season fire belt. But looking country by country, and comparing 2023 to 2024, reveals something more subtle: hotspots of increasing fire activity. The Congo region anomaly put together with the South Africa fires shows how “routine burning” can turn into full‑blown wildfire crises.</p>
        <p> It may be a slow‑moving change, but the signs are clear. Climate change is reshaping Africa’s fire regime, turning predictable burning into unpredictable emergencies.</p>
